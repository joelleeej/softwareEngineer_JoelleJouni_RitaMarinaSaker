                "We know he would not say that without the need to say it. I feel the pressure to make it work if you two get back together without time to consider this can happen again. Take your time to understand why it happened in the first place. Heal and grow and be together. Rissa whatever you did understand yourself better and who you are and where you are going to make sure you are right for him or anybody before moving forward. Your vibe was coming off a little narcissistic check yourself and I do not say that likely. I am a huge fan. I think its a power thing and the family got involved. I would never think either of you would cheat but power struggle and who feels they have more power over the other and how you got where you are and Rissa family cosigned with her.....But work it out shining stars. We love you!!!",
                "I really dont care what happen, no relationship is perfect all im saying im happy yall working on it put God in the mix and all will be much better. Keep pushing for them handsome boys. One love from out Cura\u00e7ao",
